In this current version, the app is able to read the Google Sheets, and analyze it using Gemini to send the summarize via whatsapp, now I want to make app not only summarize the data, but also provide the raw sheets data based on the specific date range that the user requested. The data will taken from the Google Sheets and make it to a PDF format which include the table that tells about the stock opname, and send it to the user via whatsapp.

The google sheets data is structured as follows:
Timestamp (column A)
Email address (column B)
PNS yang mengisi (column C)
and then the stock opname data start from column D, where each column represent the item name, and each row represent the stock status for that item on that date.
(see the file: Sarkop Daily Stock Monitoring (Responses) - Form responses 1.csv for example)

The PDF Format:
First, the PDF will have a title "Stock Opname Report"
Then, it will have a subtitle with the date range requested by the user, e.g. "Report for the period of 2025-01-01. When there are multiple dates, then after the first date complete, it will create a new page break for the next date, e.g. "2025-01-02", and so on.

Then, each date will have a table with the following columns: "Item Name", "Stock Before", "Stock After". the data for "before" is taken from the previous date's stock data, and the "after" is taken from the current date's stock data.

Finally, the PDF will be sent to the user via whatsapp along with the summary generated by Gemini.
